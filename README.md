![bark bark, good dog.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/murrty/aphrodite/master/Resources/brad.png)  
a(nother), REALLY glorified, e621 image/pool downloader

# Usage
Run, enter tags or go enter a pool id, click download. easy.

# Protocol & Userscript plugin
Yes, just like everything else, this supports a protocol. "Pools:" and "Tags:" are the ones used. Run the program as admin, click the "Protocol" item at the top of the program and it'll automatically attempt to install it for you.

The userscript plugin is available [(here)](https://github.com/murrty/aphrodite/raw/master/Resources/aphrodite.user.js). There will be buttons on the search page, image page (if it is in a pool), and the pool page.

# Blacklist
There are 2 blacklists, 1 is a "graylist" so to speak, which will download any files with those tags but will move them to a separate folder titled "blacklist". The other list is a zero-tolerance blacklist which will NOT download any files if they contain any one of the tags added. If you want specific pictures, be sure to include more than one tag and use the rating option to not include explicit images.

This supports a, essentially infinite sized, blacklist. Just add the tags you dislike into the Blacklist form and click save. You also have an option to save the blacklisted images, and pools have the option to merge it with the rest of the images.

The blacklist is mutual between tags and pools.

# aphrodite_min
Aphrodite min is a command-line version of aphrodite, supposed to minimize application size while maintaining full functionality of aphrodite. Because it's a command line application, there's no need to have extra classes and coding for visual forms. Though, because of this, it's not the prettiest.

# Brad
bark, mr bread dog.
