  "body": "this update took about 40 years but even with the alzheimers i still remember all the degenerative promises i've made.\r\n* I added an option to delete your computer.\r\n* I removed the option to undelete your demons\r\n* After drinking too much and blacking out in the gutter, i realized that all the time that i've spent on the internet really started affecting my life. I never really looked towards the next day as I used to as a child. The excitement of the new things I could do never felt the same in my later years.\r\nIt seems the more I think about it, the more it starts to stick out.\r\nPerhaps I wasn't meant to enjoy the things others can find so enjoyable. A butterfly flying in the winds of a tornado.\r\nSometimes you feel like maybe the wind is too strong. Or maybe you're easily overpowered by the tears of nature weeping for our future.\r\nI feel a snap in my conscience. Nothing ever made any sense. Who am I? As this really the world we live in?\r\n"
